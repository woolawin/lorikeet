Modern shell scripting language

## Rational
The importance of shell scripting in of computing and automation can not be understated, very few other technologies have made such an impact. It serves as the backbone of many essential tasks, enabling users to streamline and automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, and execute complex processes efficiently. With its versatility and power, shell scripting becomes an invaluable tool for system administrators, developers, and IT professionals.

However shell scripting has always been the bane of many developers experience. Bash is potentially the most unwieldy technology language in use today. Alternatives such as fish, z shell, and c shell have become popular, though their scripting component have not made significantly progressed the field as such Bash is still the de-facto shell scripting language of Linux and MacOS. On the other hand we have we developed languages such as Python that make software development much easier but ultimately does not provide an alternative to Bash as it lacks the fluent integration with command line utilities needed.

Here exists a segment of computing that has almost been left behind, a programming language designed to build software out of command line utilities that is enjoyable to use. The mission objectives of lorikeet to achieve this is:
- Allow developers to build solutions based on existing command line utilities
- As easy and enjoyable to write in as Python or any other typical high level language
- Agnostic to the users shell to become more universal then any individual shell
- Extensible to achieve tasks where needing to spawn a new process is not suitable
- Performant, not to a C/C++/Rust level but along the lines of Java/JavaScript/PHP
